# aws-deploy-cicd
This repository will attempt to put in place an end-to-end ML development, with CI/CD capabilities. Basically, a model for default prediction will be trained and then dumped to an Amazon S3 bucket. Hence, we will build a Docker container that will be automatically pushed do AWS ECR for further deployment with AWS Sagemaker.
